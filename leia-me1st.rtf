Install, update and various opther documentation can be found in the "docs"
folder/directory.
New with Version 0.06:
I have added an option so you can now use Xoops coding in artigos and no
longer have to use HTML to format the document.
If you are like me and prefer to use HTML exclusively, you can turn off Xoops
formatting coding in "cache/config.php" - set "$use_xoops_codes" to "0".
