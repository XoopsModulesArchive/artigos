2) About artigos

artigos is a module written for the XOOPS v2 content management system (CMS). 
I started using Xoops at version release 2.0.3, and generally prefer it over 
other CMS that I have tried. The only thing that I felt let it, and other CMS,
down was the "Sections" module - I basially disliked the way it worked and not
being able to list the "Sections" as text and not only as icons.

I also tried a couple of other solutions, but they to didn't do what I want,
were still very buggy, or just not very user intuitive.

So I decided to write my own, which I hope you will find useful.

3) Requirements

The artigos module requires the following:

  o A web server running PHP version 4.1.0 or later.
  o XOOPS-JP 2.0.6 or later (it should work from version 2.0.3, but has not been 
    tested with it.)
  o MySQL 3.23.5* - it should work on all mySQL 3.23.* versions, and in theory,
    should work on mySQL v4 - but again, this has not been tested.

4) Installation

Please see the INSTALL.txt text file.

5) Contact the author

You can contact Andrew Mills at ajmills@the-crescent.net.  Please only use this
address to contact me regarding the artigos module - send anything Xoops 
related to the Xoops people or community at http://www.xoops.org . If you send
it to me, I will ignore it.

6) Copyrights

All original code and content is Copyright Â© 2003 Andrew Mills. While I have 
been coding PHP for a while, I have not done much in the way of OO programming,
etc., and Xoops' documentation for writing modules is also sadly lacking at 
present, this means I have used some small snippets of code for examples from 
other modules, I acknowledge them for their hard work.

Feel free to modify and use this code in your own projects - all I ask is that
you don't pass off whole sections of it as your own work, and give me some 
credit for it :). Oh, it would also be nice if you send me any additions or
errata to the artigos code that you make.
